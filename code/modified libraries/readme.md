these are changes to external libraries. copy of the modified files, which should of course go into the arduino library itself.
this is a hack, but I don't know how to properly do it, specially considering arduino. I could do a fork and pull request...
You should get the original libraries, and then overwrite the corresponding files from the files in this folder. 

If you know of a better way of doing this, please let me know and/or create a PR yourself, I'd greatly appreciate that!
